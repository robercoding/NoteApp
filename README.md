# SimpleToDoNotesApp
SimpleToDoNotes is my first project built by myself using the knowledge that acquired in my last projects.

#### Features 
* Create a note
* Update the note
* Swipe the note to delete
* Delete as many notes you want
* Move the note from its position
* Change the UI to light or dark theme
* The app doesn't fly, yet...
